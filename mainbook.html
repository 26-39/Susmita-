          <h2>A Special Beginning ❤️✨</h2>

       <p>When I first met you at the science fair, I didn’t even know your name. But when you texted me, our journey began, without me even realizing, I was preparing myself for you.

Yes, there were bad days in between. Sometimes I was there, and sometimes, in my absence, only my wishes remained. Yet, through it all, our journey continued.

Maybe it was luck, or maybe it was destiny, but somehow, we found our way to each other. And now, every moment with you feels like a piece of something truly special,something meant to best.🫀</p>

          <p>
            When there was nothing between us, even then, you were my everything, my entire world.. <span class=""></span>...

          <p>
   When I first met you, we were just strangers, two lives crossing paths without knowing what was ahead. But as we started talking, something changed. Every conversation, every little moment with you began to feel special.

I found myself smiling more, looking forward to your messages, and feeling a kind of happiness I hadn’t known before. Your kindness, your warmth, the way you care,it all made me realize that love isn’t just a feeling, it’s you.

You are the love I didn’t know I was waiting for, the one who makes every day brighter just by being in it.

            There’s a charm about you, a beauty that words can hardly capture. It’s in the sparkle of your eyes, the warmth of your smile, and the effortless way you light up every moment. Every little thing about you feels so perfect, so mesmerizing, that I often wonder..

            Were you crafted as a masterpiece?
            
            It’s as if the universe took its time, carefully shaping someone as wonderful as you, just to make the world a little brighter. And trust me, you do. Every single day. 
            
            Your presence feels like a soft melody, soothing yet unforgettable. The way you carry yourself, the kindness in your heart, and the purity in your soul make you even more special. It’s not just about how beautiful you look,it’s about how beautiful you truly are.

          <p>
            From the very beginning, I had no idea where this journey would take us, but I always had this sense that there was something special about you. Even when I was unsure of what I was feeling, there was a strength inside me that made me push forward. I didn't always have the answers, but I had faith in us. I realized that I was preparing myself for you all along, even before I knew it. It was the strength within me, in the way I trusted my heart to lead me toward you, that kept me going, even on the toughest days.

            There’s no doubt in my mind that the best part of my day, every single day, was when I got to see you. It wasn’t just about being in the same place,it was the way my heart would race when I knew I was about to talk to you or even just see your smile. It became my daily routine to look forward to those moments, to the way you made everything brighter. You were the light that made everything else fade into the background. You were, and still are, the best part of my day.

         </h1>
          <p>
           Every time I thought about you, there was a wish that came from my heart. At first, it was simple wishes,wishing you happiness, wishing for us to stay close. But as time went on, I realized those wishes grew deeper. I wished for a future with you, for a life where we could share everything,both the good and the bad. And even when we were apart, I was always wishing for you, hoping that no matter what came our way, we'd end up exactly where we are now. With you by my side.

            I promise you that I will never leave you, not emotionally, not spiritually. I’ll be by your side through everything, supporting you, cheering you on, and reminding you that you're never alone.

          <h2>The Beauty of You ✨💖</h2>
          <p>
            
When I say "the beauty of you," I’m not just talking about the way you look though to me, you are the most beautiful person in every possible way. But true beauty is more than what the eyes can see. I see beauty in your heart, in the way you care, in the love you give so freely.

Your prayers hold a beauty beyond words. Every time you pray, I feel like my soul is wrapped in warmth, as if your prayers reach me before your words do. The sincerity in your heart, the way you wish goodness upon others, the way your love is pure and unconditional that is the beauty I admire most.

Your love itself is a masterpiece. It is gentle, yet strong. It is soft, yet powerful. It is the kind of love that makes life brighter, that turns ordinary moments into unforgettable ones. You are beautiful in the way you love, in the way you give, in the way you exist.

When I speak of "the beauty of you," I mean all of this and more. Your presence, your kindness, your faith, your love...they make this world, and my world, infinitely more beautiful.

           You’ve taken my breath away in ways I can’t even explain. It wasn’t just the big moment,it was every little thing. The way my heart raced when I saw you, the way time seemed to stand still when we were together. Those moments were so much more than I could have ever dreamed of. I never knew that love could feel this overwhelming, this beautiful, this breathtaking. And yet, every time I’m with you, I feel like I’m discovering something new and wonderful, something that takes my breath away again and again.✨

But most of all, I’m grateful for you,the way you’ve changed my life in the best possible way. You’ve been my strength when I didn’t have any left. You’ve been my hope, my happiness, and my reason to keep going.

I’ve spent so much time wondering if I was ready, if this was the right thing, and now I know that it’s not just about being ready,it’s about us. You’ve become my world, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. So, I’m asking you now:
